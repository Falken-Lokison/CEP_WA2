WA2 - Forces
This is a firefly in a field simulator, with the fireflies attracted to or being repelled by the blue chill light. The 
buttons on the screen toggles the wind, the statistics on the screen, the wind mode (Calm/Chaotic), the polarity of the 
light, the reset of the simulation (same or different seed), and the slider will control the strength of the force of the 
light. The fireflies will die after a while, so to replace them some will spawn automatically from the last recorded 
position of your cursor. Not only that, you can click your mouse to spawn at will.

I hope this project is somewhat appealing to the eye, and make it feels nice to look at the patterns of movement. Thank you
for checking this out.
